Maria set out to bake her favorite dessert: cookies.
She mixed the ingredients carefully, adding extra chocolate chips.
After baking, she let the cookies cool, but not for long.
The first bite was pure bliss, with the chocolate still warm and melted.
Maria knew her friends would love these cookies at the party tonight.
