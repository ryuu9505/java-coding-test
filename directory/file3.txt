The children ran into the kitchen after school, looking for snacks.
Their mother had baked a fresh batch of cookies that morning.
Each child grabbed a cookie, laughing as they sat around the table.
The house smelled of chocolate and sugar, making the moment even sweeter.
Nothing felt more comforting than warm cookies on a cold afternoon.
